    b_Name  for bool
    c_Name  for Char, also Color
    d_Name  for double
    e_Name  for enum variables
    f_Name  for function delegates, also float
    i_Name  for instances of classes
    k_Name  for "konstructs" (struct) (letter 's' already used for string)
	r_Name  for Rectangle
    s_Name  for strings
    o_Name  for objects
 
   s8_Name  for   signed  8 Bit (sbyte)
  s16_Name  for   signed 16 Bit (short)
  s32_Name  for   signed 32 Bit (int)
  s64_Name  for   signed 64 Bit (long)
   u8_Name  for unsigned  8 Bit (byte)
  u16_Name  for unsigned 16 bit (ushort)
